The school was originally one of the three first Central Colleges established under the education reforms of late Hon. C. W. W. Kannangara, who introduced free education in Sri Lanka. Today about 3270 students are studying from grade 6 to 13 and academic staff of 175 are engaged in the teaching process.<br>C.W.W Kannangara was Sri Lanka's first Minister of Education.[1][2]
On 6 January 1941 three central colleges, Veyangoda, Akuramboda, and Weeraketiya were opened by C.W.W Kannangara, Sri Lanka's first Minister of Education. Veyangoda Central College was created by joining three schools. They are Veyangoda Swabasha Patashalawa (Sinhala school), English school and Paththalagethara School which were in the same place where the President College, Veyangoda situated today, in the middle of Veyangoda town.

Later the school was moved into Maligathanna Watta and first building was opened by Mr.D.S. Senanayaka on 3 September 1951.

The school originally had 20 class rooms and two hostels, one for girls and one for boys, and two buildings for Home science and Vocational Training. Now there are 51 class rooms, an agriculture unit, a computer resource center and a computer lab in the college. Every pupil is entered to the college who passes the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination or G.C.E(O/L) Examination with highest results.</p></div>
